3/7/2023:
Implemented a leaderboard using services from GameJolt.
However, it doesn't work on the TeaVM version, maybe because the network code requires multi-threading? (or it doesn't exist i teh back end?)


6/7/2023:
Updated to the snapshot relase ofTeaVM (equivalent to 1.0.0-b5?) and upgraded gdx version to 1.12.  Leaderboard now works
in HTML version.
